# SillyTavern Costume Switch contributor notes

- Use four spaces for indentation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.
- Favor double quotes for string literals to match the existing style.
- Keep experimental or in-progress features clearly gated behind their feature flags.
- Update or add tests in the `test/` directory when you change profile persistence or detection logic.
- Document noteworthy UI affordances or feature flags in the settings copy so users understand experimental scope.
